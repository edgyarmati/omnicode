# GedCode

Give your coding agent a memory and a process. GedCode layers a plan-before-you-edit workflow and durable project memory on top of [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — so sessions stop forgetting, and the agent stops charging ahead without a plan.

## Install

GedCode currently ships as a JavaScript bundle and requires Node.js 22 or newer.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgyarmati/gedcode/main/install.sh | bash
gedcode
```

### Windows

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edgyarmati/gedcode/main/install.ps1 | iex
gedcode
```

Your existing `opencode` install is left alone — GedCode runs in its own sandbox.

### From a local checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edgyarmati/gedcode
cd gedcode
./scripts/setup
gedcode
```

## What you get

- **Durable project memory** in `.ged/` — spec, tasks, tests, decisions, standards, and session summaries stay on disk between runs.
- **Automatic grilling before changes** — for new features, fixes, refactors, and behavior changes, GedCode asks one focused question at a time until the request is unambiguous.
- **Documentation-aware grilling when needed** — when a change exposes domain language or durable decisions, GedCode can use an enhanced grill workflow that updates project context or ADRs instead of losing that reasoning in chat.
- **Skill-fit checkpoint** — after clarification, GedCode checks whether available skills cover the task, uses `find-skills` when relevant skills are missing, and can create a project-local skill when none exists.
- **TDD implementation discipline** — behavior-changing slices can be guided by a bundled red-green-refactor workflow, recorded in the active work `TESTS.md` before implementation.
- **Disciplined diagnosis** — bug and performance-regression work can route through a reproduce → minimize → hypothesize → instrument → fix → regression-test loop before patching.
- **Architecture review command** — `/improve-codebase-architecture` finds deepening opportunities and asks what to explore before any refactor starts.
- **Clean-context review command** — `/clean-context-review` reviews the current diff/tests with fresh eyes and requires finding adjudication before commit.
- **Optional native subagents** — `/ged-agents` can opt into read-only intelligence helpers (`ged-explorer`, `ged-planner`, `ged-verifier`) while preserving GedCode's single-writer default. There is no writer subagent role.
- **Plan before edit** — when Omni mode is on, the agent can't touch your files until `SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `TESTS.md` have real content.
- **Repo awareness** — a ranked repo map keeps the agent oriented in large codebases.
- **Skill discovery and local creation** — relevant skills are surfaced and loaded automatically; if discovery cannot find a fit, GedCode can write a narrow local skill under `.ged/skills/` without touching global user skills.
- **Collaboration-safe memory direction** — shared project knowledge stays durable, while active work is moving toward per-branch `.ged/work/<branch>/` plans and protected-branch guardrails.
- **Token savings** — RTK is installed and wired up automatically, compressing bash command output by 60-90% so the agent uses fewer tokens on git, ls, test runs, and more.
- **Zero impact on your normal setup** — the `gedcode` launcher uses its own isolated config, so regular `opencode` keeps working exactly as before.

OpenCode still owns the terminal UI, models, providers, auth, sessions, tools, and runtime. GedCode only adds the workflow layer.

## The Omni workflow

1. **Bootstrap** — `.ged/` is seeded in your project the first time you run GedCode there.
2. **Grill** — for change requests, clarify one question at a time until behavior, constraints, non-goals, tests, and success criteria are concrete. Use the docs-aware variant when domain terms or durable decisions should be recorded.
3. **Check skills** — judge whether bundled/project skills cover the clarified task; if not, use `find-skills`, then create a project-local `.ged/skills/` skill with `skill-maker` when no adequate skill exists.
4. **Plan** — write real `SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `TESTS.md` in the active planning directory. Until you do, the edit/write guard is active.
5. **Test-drive when applicable** — for behavior-changing slices, record the behavior, public seam, expected red failure, focused test command, and verification command in `TESTS.md`.
6. **Diagnose before patching** — for unknown bugs and regressions, establish a feedback loop and cause before writing the fix.
7. **Execute** — work bounded task slices guided by the plan, with the primary `gedcode` agent as the active-worktree writer and decision owner by default.
8. **Review and verify** — run planned checks, use clean-context review for meaningful implementation diffs, adjudicate findings, then update state/session summaries so the next run picks up where you left off.

For the current subagent/orchestration model, see [`docs/current-orchestration-model.md`](docs/current-orchestration-model.md). For collaborative repositories, see the planned per-branch work-memory model in [`docs/2026-04-30-collaborative-memory-design.md`](docs/2026-04-30-collaborative-memory-design.md).
GedCode's collaboration checkpoint reports the current branch, protected-branch policy, active `.ged/work/<branch-slug>/` planning directory, planning readiness, and next recommended action when starting or resuming change work.
Use `gedcode_start_work` to deliberately create or switch to a feature branch and initialize that branch's work-memory directory; it refuses dirty checkouts by default and suggests committing, stashing, or explicitly allowing dirty work.
PR behavior is controlled by `workflow.offerPrOnCompletion` and `workflow.autoCreatePrOnCompletion`; by default GedCode offers to open a PR when work is complete but does not create one unless asked.
Use `gedcode_migrate_root_plan` to copy an existing non-placeholder root plan into the active branch-scoped `.ged/work/<branch-slug>/` directory while keeping root files intact for compatibility.

Branch-scoped runtime state under `.ged/runtime/<branch-slug-or-root>/STATE.md` is injected into OpenCode's compaction context, so active state survives long sessions without creating a shared root-state bottleneck.

Run `/improve-codebase-architecture` when you want a review-only architecture pass. GedCode will inspect docs/code and return numbered deepening opportunities, then wait for you to choose a candidate before treating any refactor as an implementation change.

Run `/clean-context-review` before committing meaningful implementation changes when you want the review loop explicit. It inspects the current diff/tests in blind or contract mode, reports findings by severity with evidence and confidence, and requires the primary orchestrator to accept, reject, or escalate each finding before commit.

Run `/ged-agents` to review or update optional native subagent settings. Settings are read from `~/.gedcode/settings.json` plus a gitignored project override at `.gedcode/settings.json`; optional model guidance can live in `model-recommendations.md` in either settings directory. GedCode treats subagents as intelligence contributors by default: `ged-explorer` returns discovery packets, `ged-planner` critiques plans as a smart friend, and `ged-verifier` runs checks or clean-context review. Writes, commits, PR decisions, and final verification judgments stay with the primary orchestrator. Writer subagents are not implemented.

## Quick usage

```bash
gedcode
```

Then just talk to it. For example:

> "Bootstrap this project and tell me what we're working with."

> "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page."

> "Review the auth flow for security issues."

GedCode will bootstrap `.ged/` automatically on first use in a new project, then follow a plan → implement → verify workflow for every task. You don't need to pass inline prompts or CLI flags — just open it and have a conversation.

Replace `<provider>/<model>` with any model identifier OpenCode supports (for example, `opencode/hy3-preview-free`).

## How isolation works

The `gedcode` launcher starts OpenCode with an GedCode-specific config home so it does not inherit your normal OpenCode plugins or config:

- `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config/gedcode`
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG=~/.config/gedcode/opencode/opencode.json`
- `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/gedcode/opencode`
- `OPENCODE_CLIENT=gedcode`

Both `gedcode` and your regular `opencode` use the same underlying OpenCode binary — they just point at different config roots.

GedCode behavior settings are resolved from:

- global user settings: `~/.gedcode/settings.json`
- optional project-local override: `.gedcode/settings.json`

The current workflow policy supports protected-branch settings such as `workflow.protectedBranches`, `workflow.requireFeatureBranchForChanges`, and `workflow.allowProtectedBranchChanges`. When feature branches are required, GedCode blocks source edits and mutating shell commands on protected branches such as `main`/`master` unless an explicit settings override allows them.

## Use GedCode as a permanent OpenCode plugin

If you'd rather have GedCode available in every `opencode` session, you can load it as a regular plugin instead of going through the `gedcode` launcher. This trades isolation for always-on availability.

| Mode | Isolation | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gedcode` launcher (recommended) | Fully isolated config and plugin loading. | The default for almost everyone. |
| Permanent plugin | None — GedCode becomes part of your normal OpenCode setup. | You want the Omni workflow in every `opencode` session. |

### From an GedCode install

After installing GedCode, point your normal OpenCode config at the bundled plugin file.

Typical plugin paths:

- macOS / Linux: `~/.local/share/gedcode/lib/plugin/index.js`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GedCode\lib\plugin\index.js`

Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    "file:///Users/you/.local/share/gedcode/lib/plugin/index.js"
  ]
}
```

To make GedCode the default agent there as well:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "default_agent": "gedcode",
  "plugin": [
    "file:///Users/you/.local/share/gedcode/lib/plugin/index.js"
  ]
}
```

### From a source checkout

Build the plugin first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edgyarmati/gedcode
cd gedcode
npm install
npm run build
```

Then point OpenCode at the built plugin:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    "file:///ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/gedcode/packages/plugin/dist/index.js"
  ]
}
```

The `gedcode` launcher is still the recommended path — permanent-plugin mode is supported but skips the isolation you get for free otherwise.

## Repo hygiene

`.ged/` is intentionally split into **durable** and **runtime** state.

Commit these when they reflect real project intent:

- `PROJECT.md`, `SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, `TESTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `STANDARDS.md`, `SKILLS.md`, `CONFIG.md`, `VERSION`, `.gitignore`

These stay out of git — they're regenerated each run:

- `runtime/`, `STATE.md`, `SESSION-SUMMARY.md`, `REPO-MAP.md`, `REPO-MAP.json`

`.pi/` also stays out of git.

## Troubleshooting

- **Testing from a checkout** — use `./scripts/setup` rather than the release installer.
- **Managed OpenCode install fails** — rerun `gedcode` and follow the printed fallback command using the same `--prefix` path.
- **Launcher verification fails during install** — rerun the installer with the same `GEDCODE_VERSION`; it verifies the extracted launcher with `gedcode --check` before creating the final wrapper.
- **Installer download fails** — confirm the tagged release contains the expected assets listed in [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md).

## Development

```bash
./scripts/setup   # installs deps, builds, links launcher, installs RTK
npm run check
npm test
```

RTK is optional — GedCode works without it. When present, bash tool calls to git, test runners, ls, grep, and other supported commands are automatically compressed for token savings.

Release artifacts are produced by `.github/workflows/release.yml` from tagged versions. See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md) for the release runbook.
