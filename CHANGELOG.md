# Changelog

## 0.3.0

### Features

- **Automatic grill-me clarification** — change requests (new features, fixes, refactors, migrations) now automatically trigger a one-question-at-a-time interview until behavior, constraints, non-goals, edge cases, and success criteria are concrete enough to plan safely.
- **Enforced skill-fit checkpoint** — after clarification, the agent judges whether bundled/project skills cover the task. If not, it uses `find-skills` to discover relevant external skills before planning. Supports removing skills from project memory when the user requests it.
- **Project-local skill maker workflow** — when `find-skills` cannot find adequate coverage, OmniCode can create a narrow local skill under `.omni/skills/` for the current project without installing global user skills.
- **Workflow settings primitives** — OmniCode now resolves protected-branch workflow policy from global `~/.omnicode/settings.json` plus optional project-local `.omnicode/settings.json` overrides and exposes the effective policy in state output.
- **Protected-branch workflow guard** — source edits and mutating shell commands are blocked on protected branches such as `main`/`master` by default once planning is ready, unless global or project OmniCode settings explicitly allow direct protected-branch changes.
- **Branch-scoped planning path helpers** — OmniCode can derive safe work IDs from git branch names and select `.omni/work/<branch-slug>/` planning paths with root planning fallback when no branch is available.
- **Active work planning guard** — the plan-before-edit guard now prefers branch-scoped `.omni/work/<branch-slug>/SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, and `TESTS.md` while still accepting legacy root planning files as a migration fallback.
- **Collaboration checkpoint status** — agents can now report the current branch, protected-branch policy, active Omni work-memory path, planning readiness, root fallback use, and next recommended action before starting or resuming change work.
- **Explicit start-work workflow** — added `omnicode_start_work` to create or switch to a feature branch, initialize `.omni/work/<branch-slug>/`, and refuse dirty checkouts by default with proposed safe next steps.
- **PR completion settings and tool** — added PR workflow settings for offering or auto-creating PRs on completion plus explicit `omnicode_create_pr` support that can push the branch when needed and builds a PR body from active planning context.
- **Root plan migration tool** — added `omnicode_migrate_root_plan` to copy non-placeholder root `.omni` planning files into the active branch-scoped work directory with overwrite protection and migration notes.
- **Branch-scoped runtime state** — runtime state and session summaries now write to `.omni/runtime/<branch-slug-or-root>/` instead of root singleton files, with runtime directories ignored by git.
- **TDD workflow skill** — added bundled `tdd` guidance for behavior-changing slices, with active-work `TESTS.md` expectations for red-green-refactor planning and verification.
- **Diagnose workflow skill** — added bundled bug/performance-regression guidance for reproduce, minimize, hypothesize, instrument, fix, and regression-test loops.
- **Grill-with-docs workflow skill** — added a documentation-aware clarification variant for domain language, durable context, and ADR-worthy decisions.
- **Architecture improvement command** — added `/improve-codebase-architecture` as a review-only workflow that surfaces deepening opportunities before any refactor begins.

### Fixes

- **Harden plugin workflow guardrails** — blocks mutating bash commands (shell redirections, `rm`, `cp`, `tee`, etc.) before planning artifacts exist. Replaces string-based `.omni` path matching with resolved path containment. Preserves user-managed `SKILLS.md` project notes across updates.
- **Harden launcher install checks** — adds `--check` and `--version` flags that return without launching or installing the managed OpenCode runtime. Updates POSIX and Windows installers to use `--check` for verification instead of running the launcher.
- **Windows-safe plugin shim imports** — generates `file://` URL import specifiers in the plugin shim so Windows absolute drive paths are valid ESM module specifiers.
- **Write plugin `.omni` files atomically** — all plugin-generated durable/runtime files are written through an atomic rename helper that preserves existing file permissions.
- **Sanitize generated markdown** — state, session summary, skill, repo map, and standards content is sanitized so tool inputs or imported file contents cannot inject new top-level markdown structure.
- **Harden semver comparison** — launcher version comparison correctly handles prerelease identifiers and ignores build metadata per semver precedence rules.
- **Reject untrusted `OMNICODE_SETUP_TARGET`** — validates the env var matches `omnicode[@version]` before passing it to `npm install -g`.
- **Reject non-semver version strings from `current.json`** — managed runtime metadata is validated against strict semver before use as a path segment.
- **Harden `readSkill` and `importStandards`** — skill name validation refuses traversal/null-byte escapes; standards import verifies resolved paths stay under the project root.
- **Write `opencode.json` and plugin shim atomically with 0600 perms** — launcher config writes refuse to follow symlinks and keep files private.

### Performance

- **Summarize repo map files concurrently** — repo map generation uses a bounded concurrency pool (16 workers) instead of sequential file reads.

### CI / Release

- **Gate release on `npm run check` and `npm test`** — the release workflow runs type-checking and tests before building the bundle.
- **Publish installer scripts as release assets** — `install.sh` and `install.ps1` are uploaded alongside the tarball and `SHA256SUMS`.
- **Verify SHA256SUMS in installers** — both POSIX and Windows installers download and verify checksums before extracting the release archive.
- **Align release bundle documentation** — release metadata, workflow, installers, README, AGENTS, and release checklist now consistently describe the current generic JS bundle artifact.
- **Keep changelog updates with every committed change** — repository agent guidance now requires each committed slice to update `CHANGELOG.md` for the next release so release notes stay complete.
- **Design collaboration-safe Omni memory** — documented the planned split between shared project memory, per-branch `.omni/work/<branch>/` planning, untracked runtime state, and protected-branch settings guardrails.
